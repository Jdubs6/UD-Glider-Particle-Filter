Hope you're having a great day so far! This repository contains the progress on the particle filter used for the glider project in the Autonomous Underwater Systems Bootcamp. 

Contained are two files: "Particle Filter Part 2 with Weights -- with File Opening" and "Particle Filter Part 2 with Weights"

The filters can take up to two sets of datapoints at a time, each having an initial_position, commanded_position, and actual_position. 
When the code is ran, it will ask if this the 
Both filters use a weight system to eliminate outliers in the dataset and make the filter more accurate.
